Numerical problems are considered on general synchronization of chaotic oscillators, through the evaluation of the Lower Bound Error index on two case studies: a Lorenz system unidirectionally coupled to a Duffing system and a Duffing system unidirectionally coupled to a Rossler system. It was possible to observe, in each case, that the behavior of the slave's LBE curve tends to follow the behavior of the master's as the value of the coupling constant is increased up to a certain value, and thus, that synchronization can affect numerical calculations.
